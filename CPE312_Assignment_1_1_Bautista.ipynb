For underfitting this can be seen as having high bias and low variance. As a result the model cannot generalize well because its does not see the underlying relationship in the dataset. On the hand, overfitting will have a low bias but high vairance. The model can give reliable predictions in the training data but will lose its reliabilty when given the test data or unseen data. This is because the model is fitting too much on the training data which causes to decrease it reliability in generalization."
